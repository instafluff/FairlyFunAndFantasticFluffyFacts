when you are cooking double the recipe and freeze one, you can use it on a night you are too tired to cook so it will stop you from buying an expensive take-away
line the bottom of your grill with tin foil so it's easier to clean after cooking, you only need to remove the foil and wipe down
if you know you wont use all of your fresh fruits and vegetables you can cut and prep them and freeze them in freezer bags but double bag so they are less likely to get freezer burn. you can then use them in sauce and smoothies
